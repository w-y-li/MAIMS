Yes
Based on the poster's responses to the questions of the mental scale, they consistently indicate symptoms of depression, such as feeling sad all the time, having a pessimistic outlook on the future, feeling like a failure, experiencing a loss of pleasure, self-dislike, feeling worthless, lacking energy, changes in appetite, difficulty concentrating, and a loss of interest in sex. These symptoms align with criteria commonly used to diagnose depression.

Correct
Ensure you consider both the presence and absence of symptoms in your analysis. Remain objective and avoid overgeneralizing or inferring negative characteristics that are not supported by the evidence.
