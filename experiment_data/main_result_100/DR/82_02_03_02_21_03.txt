Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Should I still communicate with my father? Hello everyone. So the past few days my mom caught my dad cheating on her (2 women specifically). Now my mom sent him a closure to cut the ties (we live on the US while my dad is on another country). I'm angry and familiar with this feeling as well because my previous girlfriend cheated on me too (I guess it runs on the blood to be cheated on). Right now I don't know if I should cut my ties as well, as I can't forgive someone who broke my mom's heart and also someone who can't be contented at all. I'm 24 and take full responsibility on her. Our little family is all what my mom have, as she never worked her whole life and expended it to nurture us her children, giving up her career and dreams.

Do Mental Health Analysis:

ITER 0
Yes
The poster's responses indicate symptoms of depression such as feeling sad much of the time, discouragement about the future, feeling like they have failed more than the average person, difficulty making decisions, having less energy, being more irritable than usual, and finding it hard to keep their mind on anything for very long. These symptoms suggest a potential diagnosis of depression.

Correct
Ensure that you base your analysis strictly on the evidence presented in both the social media post and the results of the mental health scale. While the analysis in this instance was correct, remember not to infer additional negative characteristics without clear evidence. Moreover, carefully distinguish between the mental health of the poster and others mentioned in the post to avoid confusion. Maintain a disciplined approach to each individual case based on the presented data to avoid overgeneralization and assumption.
