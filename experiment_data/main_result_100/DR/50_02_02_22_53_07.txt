Do Mental Health Analysis:

ITER 0
Yes
The poster's answers on the mental scale indicate symptoms related to depression, such as feeling guilty most of the time, not feeling guilty a good part of the time, and being too tired or fatigued to do most of the things they used to do.

Incorrect
Be cautious about drawing conclusions without significant evidence. The poster only expressed feelings of guilt and fatigue, which alone are not sufficient to diagnose depression. Look for a pattern or a constellation of symptoms that are persistent and disrupt daily functioning. Consider the context of the post and the scale responses carefully, and avoid overgeneralizing or inferring symptoms that have not been indicated.

ITER 1
No
The poster did not show significant evidence of depression. They only mentioned feeling guilty and fatigued, which alone are not enough to diagnose depression. Additionally, their responses to the mental scale questions did not indicate any other symptoms commonly associated with depression.

Correct
