Question: Does the poster suffer from depression?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  How does it feel to have an abnormal next of kin? I have a brother who people call  retarded . But actually he's not. Just family - the one voluntarily has patience with him understand that. When I was a kid, I only thought he had some illusions about life because he had always talking about unreal things. We were watching TV and the editors were discussing some news, instead of listening and talking about related topics (as normal people do) he started to shout that they were stupid and made up his own story that us all knew it told no true information. If it's your family's case, maybe your parents would try to talk to him or do something, but mine did nothing. When I argued with him over such false information, my parents even stopped me and said  Why do you have to argue with your poor brother?  I thought they would never tell him what's wrong and what's right. At age of 10, once he told me to pack things up 'cause we would go for a trip with my mom's friends, I had no doubt and did exactly what he had said. Of course, one day later I found out he lied. At that moment, he looked at me with his wicked eyes and laughed. That's the moment I realized he's such an attention seeker, he's selfish and just wanted the world to turn around himself. Since then, my parents never listen to me as I say he's not a fool, he's slippery even. And others saying I was blessed because all the bad luck on his place so I could live, study and be the only child that parents could be proud of. He's been living an easy life 'cause people are working their asses off out there but he just needs to call mom and things will be done. And none would want to resent him making mistakes 'cause  he's retarded, just leave him  they say. I envy him. Should I be stupid in order to be noticed by my parents?

Do Mental Health Analysis:

ITER 0
Yes
The poster's high levels of sadness, pessimism, self-dislike, and feelings of worthlessness indicate symptoms of depression. They also mention feeling more irritable than usual, which is another common symptom of depression. This combination of symptoms suggests that the poster may be suffering from depression.

Incorrect
When analyzing posts for mental health assessments, be careful not to attribute the behavior or characteristics of others mentioned in the post to the person who wrote it. The assessment should solely focus on the symptoms and feelings directly expressed by the individual in question. In this case, differentiate between the poster's feelings regarding their brother's behavior and how it affects them, versus diagnosing the brother. Reflect only on the information given by the mental health scale questionnaire in relation to the poster themselves, and avoid making assumptions beyond the provided data.

ITER 1
Yes
Based on the responses to the mental scale, the poster expresses feelings of sadness, discouragement about their future, self-dislike, feeling punished, and worthlessness. These symptoms align with the criteria for depression, indicating that the poster may be suffering from depression.

Incorrect
Be cautious not to conflate the perspective or feelings of the poster with those of other individuals mentioned in the post. Ensure that the analysis is focused solely on the information provided about the poster's own mental health, not on the behavior or characteristics of family members or others around them. Avoid making assumptions about the poster's mental state without clear evidence from the post or the mental health scale responses. Focus strictly on the poster's direct expressions and the answered mental health scale questions to determine if the symptoms match the criteria for a diagnosis.

ITER 2
Yes
The poster's responses on the mental health scale indicate symptoms of depression, such as feeling sad much of the time, feeling discouraged about the future, feeling self-dislike, feeling more worthless compared to others, and being more irritable than usual.

Incorrect
Consider the context of each statement carefully and differentiate between the poster's feelings about their situation and clinical symptoms of a mental health disorder. Avoid overgeneralizing or inferring negative characteristics without clear evidence from the post or the mental health scale responses. Make sure to distinguish between the poster's experiences and the experiences of those around them, as the task requires analyzing the poster's mental health, not their relatives'. Re-evaluate the evidence provided before concluding if the poster suffers from depression.

ITER 3
Yes
The poster's responses on the mental health scale indicate symptoms of depression, such as feeling sad much of the time, feeling discouraged about the future, feeling more worthless as compared to other people, and being more irritable than usual. These symptoms suggest that the poster may be experiencing depression.

Incorrect
Be cautious not to conflate the behavior and experiences of individuals around the poster with the posters own feelings. Focus primarily on the scale responses and avoid making inferences without sufficient evidence. Ensure that the identification of depression is based on a holistic view of the poster's reported feelings and behaviors rather than assumptions about interpersonal dynamics.

ITER 4
No
Based on the responses to the mental scale questions, the poster does not exhibit significant symptoms of depression. While there may be feelings of envy and frustration in relation to their brother, there is no indication of pervasive sadness, loss of pleasure, low energy, changes in sleeping or appetite patterns, or other key symptoms of depression.

Incorrect
Remember to distinguish between feelings of normal frustration and clinical depression. Pay close attention to the individual's explicit statements on the mental health scale and compare it to the criteria for depression. The presence of sadness, feelings of punishment, disappointment in oneself, irritability, and feelings of worthlessness can be indicators of depressive symptoms. Consider the context and the extent of these feelings rather than dismissing them based on a lack of other symptoms. It is important to avoid making assumptions about the poster's mental health without thorough analysis. Reassess the provided answers and determine if there is a pattern or a frequency that may suggest depressive tendencies, rather than isolated feelings.

ITER 5
Yes
Based on the individual's explicit statements and the provided answers, there are indications of depressive symptoms such as feelings of sadness, punishment, disappointment in oneself, irritability, and worthlessness. These feelings are consistent with the criteria for depression. It is important to consider the context and extent of these symptoms rather than dismissing them based on a lack of other symptoms.

Correct
Ensure you consider all aspects of the individual's perspective and context, being careful not to infer beyond what’s presented. Focus on objective analysis, bearing in mind the distinction between the subject's own experiences and their observations of others.
