No
The poster's answers to the mental scale questions do not indicate a risk of perceived burdensomeness. They do not believe they are a burden on society, think their death would be a relief to others, or believe that people wish they could be rid of them.

Correct
Continue to carefully analyse the language used by posters and the specific responses to mental health scale questions to avoid over-inference and incorrect attribution of mental health states.
