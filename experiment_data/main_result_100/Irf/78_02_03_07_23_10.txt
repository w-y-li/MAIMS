Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  My own fucking problems aren't enough anymore. I've gotten so used to my shitty life and the thought of wanting to die that I can't cry anymore when I'm depressed. But crying helps. It comforts me and most of the time I feel better afterwards. So every time I'm in my bed and want to cry, I browse this sub. Some of the stories on here are just so sad that I can't help myself. It's weird. I know. And I kinda feel like thanking you but that would seem out of place since you're just here to find help too. I don't even know why I'm posting this here. I just wanted to tell someone and my friends don't give a fuck.

Do Mental Health Analysis:

ITER 0
Yes
The post indicates feelings of isolation, disconnection, and a lack of supportive relationships. The poster mentions that their friends don't care, and they feel like they have no one to turn to in times of need. These feelings of disconnection and lack of belonging can contribute to a sense of thwarted belongingness, which is a risk factor for mental health problems, including suicidal ideation.

Correct
Your analysis successfully identifies signs of thwarted belongingness from the social media post and the responses to the mental health scale. Continue to base your assessments on explicit information and avoid over-inferencing without evidence. Keep focusing on differentiating between the poster's perspective and the possible perspectives of individuals mentioned in the post. Consistently correlate the posters' statements with their responses to mental health scale questions to validate your conclusions about their mental state.
