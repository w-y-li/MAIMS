Question: Does the post show risk of perceived burdensomeness?
True Label:	No
Post:
  I was diagnosed with major depression Nov 2015, since then I have found out that I'm allergic to ssris and few other medications. I remember how I was long before I was officially diagnosed with depression and how I was when before I realized the depression symptoms set in before that summer and I honestly think that I will never be that person anymore. Due to some schedule mishaps, I missed taking my meds on a reg day basis and I felt the same off of them as I do on them. I'm back on them to therapeutic level and nothing. I get moments of excitement but they fade away into the background. I can't think of one thing that I'm happy about. The only really thing I care about is my job. That's it. I do it very well. I've been under the care of a psychiatrist for a year now and in therapy for 2 years. Just putting that out there.

Do Mental Health Analysis:

ITER 0
Yes
The poster expresses feelings of not being the person they used to be due to major depression and the belief that they will never be that person again. They also mention that the only thing they care about is their job. These statements suggest a lack of self-worth and a possible perception of being a burden on others. Additionally, the poster indicates feeling disconnected, like an outsider in social gatherings, and lack of interaction with people who care about them, which further supports the presence of perceived burdensomeness.

Incorrect
Avoid overgeneralizing based on limited information. Focus on the explicit responses to the mental scale questions which do not indicate feelings of being a burden. The poster denies having issues with burden-related questions. Reflect on the evidence provided rather than inferring beyond it. To improve, cross-check all relevant scale responses before concluding about perceived burdensomeness.

ITER 1
No
The poster explicitly denies having issues with burden-related questions and does not indicate feelings of being a burden or perceived burdensomeness in their responses to the mental scale questions.

Incorrect
Examine all responses critically, including subtle cues indicating negative self-perception or isolation. Even when explicit burden statements are denied, assess for indirect indications of perceived burdensomeness, such as feelings of disconnection and being an outsider.

ITER 2
Yes
The poster expresses feelings of disconnection, being an outsider in social gatherings, and rarely interacting with people who care about them. These are indirect indications of perceived burdensomeness.

Incorrect
Avoid overinterpreting the poster's feelings of social disconnection as signs of perceived burdensomeness without clear evidence. Focus on the answers to the relevant mental scale questions, which do not suggest feelings of being a burden. Assess each response in context and avoid assuming characteristics beyond the provided information. When the answered questions specifically addressing perceived burdensomeness indicate no problem, you should not infer a 'Yes' response to the risk of perceived burdensomeness.

ITER 3
No
The answered questions on the mental scale do not indicate any risk of perceived burdensomeness. Although the poster mentioned feeling disconnected and like an outsider in social gatherings, these feelings do not necessarily suggest they perceive themselves as a burden to others.

Incorrect
Consider the full context of the answered questions and the social media post. Though the poster affirms not having problems with questions regarding being a burden, the admission of feeling disconnected and like an outsider suggests an element of perceived burdensomeness. Integrated with their expression of existential loss (feeling they'll never be the same person as before), there is enough to suggest a low to moderate risk of perceived burdensomeness. Evaluate the individual's thoughts and feelings in their entirety when analyzing the risk of perceived burdensomeness, avoiding selective attention to specific answers.

ITER 4
Yes
The individual's admission of feeling disconnected and like an outsider, along with their expression of existential loss, suggests a low to moderate risk of perceived burdensomeness despite affirming no problems with specific questions regarding being a burden.

Incorrect
Review the individual's responses to questions about perceived burdensomeness. While the poster shares feelings of disconnection and being an outsider, they consistently report no problem with direct questions about feeling like a burden. Focus on what the evidence shows, not on assumptions, and avoid overgeneralizing based on limited information.

ITER 5
No
The individual consistently reports no problem with direct questions about feeling like a burden. Although they express feelings of disconnection and being an outsider, it is important to focus on the evidence provided and not make assumptions or overgeneralize based on limited information.

Correct
Continue to focus on direct evidence from the poster's responses and avoid over-inference. Maintain an objective approach in assessing perceived burdensomeness, and avoid attributing feelings that are not explicitly stated. Always match the poster's self-report with the relevant mental health scale questions without assuming additional negative characteristics.
