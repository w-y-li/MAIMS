Question: Does the post show risk of thwarted belongingness?
True Label:	Yes
Post:
  Hey, I created an account because I honestly dont know what I am doing anymore on here. Last year was the worst of my life. My long time GF (4 years) and I broke up. She lives in a different state so I flew there to speak to her and atleast end it on good terms. The day after I started a new job. It started well with my manager happy but the next week I had another manager who joined (the person who hired me was sacked). Towards the end of the first month, I ended up having surgery on my back. This is where the issues started, The surgery and the breakup really affected me physically and mentally and I kept making errors which were easily avoidable. Eventually it got too much for them and they released me. It took me 3 years to find the job in my field which I graduated in and i honestly thought it was what I was looking for. Unfortunately, I got left with no job and now no partner. I have a job now - in my field but not exactly the same (if that makes sense) but it is really going nowhere. My manager is good and is happy with my performance but the organisation does not allow for any growth. The person who I replaced is younger than me and is already far ahead in their career than I will. To top it all off, I live in a small town and it will be hard to hide the termination. I honestly dont know what is the point anymore. No matter what I do, it feels it is never enough and I am not going anywhere

The post indicates a sense of isolation and loneliness, particularly after the breakup and loss of the job. The poster mentions feeling like they are not going anywhere and that no matter what they do, it is never enough. These feelings suggest a risk of thwarted belongingness, which is a key factor in mental health concerns.
